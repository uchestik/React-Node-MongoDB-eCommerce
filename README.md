This is an eCommerce app. The goal of this app is to make search queries to the database that sorts out products.
The second goal is to enable only an admin make edits to products 
This project was completed in 4 hours from start to finish so there might be bugs because of the time constraint.
For ease-of-use I added an upload page to help with posting products to the database

To test this project locally there are a few steps

1) clone this project on a computer that has Node.js and MongoDB pre-installed or install Node.js and MongoDB
2) Open this project in a text editor and change directories to point to this project
3) In the command line run 'mongod' to start MongoDB
4) In a different Terminal / command line run 'node server.js' to start the Node.js server
5) In a different Terminal / Command line run 'npm start' to boot react app. Make sure app is running on a port thats not port 3000

DESKTOP VIEW ONLY - 4 hour project. Did not have time to optimize for mobile.
